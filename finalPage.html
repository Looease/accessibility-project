    <p>For people on the autistic spectrum, new spaces can present a lot of challenges.</p>
    <p>Autistic people may be intensely sensitive (hypersensitive) or under-sensitive (hyposensitive) to one or more sensory stimuli. The constant bombardment of sound, light, colours, patterns, numbers, smells and feelings can become too much, and cause an overwhelming sensory overload.</p>
    <p>In a new and crowded space like a museum, many autistic people experience stress, anxiety and sometimes ‘meltdowns’ or 'shutdowns'.</p>
    <p>There are plenty of simple changes that museums can implement to make spaces more autism-friendly:</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
      <li><p>Make guides available before people visit your institution, either as simple photo stories or downloadable PDF files. These should be appropriate for autistic people (remembering there are adult autistic people as well as children) and should be developed in collaboration with autistic people. These should also be available upon arrival at the museum so those without access to your website can make use of them
</p></li>
      <li><p>Provide information on the quietest time to visit, or create events when visitor numbers are limited, for example Dawnosaurs events run by the Natural History Museum</p></li>
      <li><p>Train all staff how to best support visitors with autism during their visit</p></li>
      <li><p>Create a relaxation space or quiet room away from distractions and other people</p></li>
      <li><p>Provide noise cancelling headphones</p></li>
      <li><p>Make sure that all maps and instructions communicate information clearly and simply</p></li>
      <li><p>Use PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) as visual aids to accompany displays, and to inform autistic visitors how to interact with displays</p></li>
      <li><p>Reduce sensory distraction or overload by maximising natural light and reducing use of fluorescent lighting</p></li>
      <li><p>Avoid the use of bright white paint - muted and soft neutral colours are better for those on the autistic spectrum</p></li>
    </ul>
