    <h1>Welcome to our Autism Accessibility Training Guide</h1>
    <p>Autism is a condition which affects how a person experiences the world around them. Autistic people see, hear and feel the world in a different way to other people.</p>
    <p>Although autistic traits vary between individuals, many autistic people experience difficult accessing public spaces.</p>
    <p>With this website, we hope to raise awareness of how public spaces can be made more accessible using our example of a trip to a museum.</p>
